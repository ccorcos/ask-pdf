MEMO TO: Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Board of Directors  
FROM: Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
SUBJECT: Notice of Claim Received from Cari McCormick  

On August 1, 2023, the District received notice of an administrative charge filed by Cari McCormick with the California Civil Rights Department, naming as respondents the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), Lake County, and the State of California.

The claim concerns how certain pension benefits are calculated and paid through CalPERS. Those claims are brought on behalf of a putative class of California public employees and against a putative class of California public entity employers who employed one or more members of the proposed plaintiff class. All California public agencies who may have employed one or more members of the proposed plaintiff class were presented with the charge as a government claim.

The District’s legal counsel has recommended the Board reject this claim as insufficient under Government Code section 910.8. This matter is placed on the August regular Board meeting agenda as a minute action in the consent calendar. Should the claimant move forward with further legal action, the claim will appear on a future agenda as a closed session item.

Respectfully submitted,  
Michael J. Aho

## II. Background  
Each year the Board of Directors must adopt the District’s Preliminary Budgets prior to July 1 which provides funding for District operations for the coming fiscal year (beginning July 1 and ending June 30). When the Preliminary Budgets are adopted in June, the final year-end financial data is not yet available as the current fiscal year does not end until June 30. Final Budgets are adopted in August/September which include the best available data from the prior fiscal year (final fund balance, actual revenue collections, and actual expenditures) and serves as the District’s expenditure plan for the fiscal year ahead. The Final Budget was discussed with and reviewed by the Finance and Budget Committee on Monday, August 7, and their comments are included in this report.  

## III. Problem /Situation / Request  
### FY 23/24 Recommended Final Budget  
The FY 23/24 recommended Final budget totals $3,312,068 and contains full-year funding for authorized permanent positions, services and supplies expenditures and capital expenditures. The Final Budget was prepared with the year-end actual expenditure/revenue data. The following highlights provide information on changes from the FY 23/24 Preliminary Budget to the recommended FY 23/24 Final Budget.  

### Salaries and Benefits  
#### Salaries  
Salaries and benefits increased from Preliminary Budget by total of $23K. There were some savings in extra help, workers’ compensation insurance, and retirement health benefits that offset the increase in full-time salaries stemming from the 5% COLA request by the Employees’ Association.  

#### COLA  
In March 2023, the Employees' Association requested a COLA in line with the California All-Urban Consumer Price Index as is directed by the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The initial request was for 7.3%, the full amount of the CIP increase. After meeting with the District Administrator and reviewing the District’s budget constraints, the Association agreed to revise their request to 5%.  

The Management and Personnel Committee met with the Employees Association in May and requested additional information before making a recommendation on the COLA. The requested benchmarking information is included with this staff report. The benchmarking shows that the District is close to the bottom of the market for most of its full-time positions. The requested COLA would help to avoid the necessity for a large salary adjustment when the next salary study is completed next year, and will allow the District to retain staff and attract new employees.
<!-- Page 87 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

After reviewing the information, both Committee Members agreed to recommend the COLA. The information was also presented to the Budget and Finance Committee who agreed to recommend the COLA as presented.

**Health Care Costs**  
The Preliminary Budget contained a 5% increase for anticipated health care cost increases. The actual increase based on CalPERS premiums is 6%. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Employees association provides for a maximum 7% increase in health care premiums in any fiscal year. The Resolution establishing health care rates consistent with the methodology set forth in the MOU resulted in an increase in the limits as indicated below.

|          | Single   | 2-Party   | Family     |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| FY 23/24 | $1083.98 | $2167.96  | $2,818.35  |
| FY 22/23 | $1045.68 | $2091.36  | $2,718.77  |

There was an increase from Preliminary to Final budget of $3,025 based on the rates CalPERS released in July for active employees, but a decrease of $7,560 for retiree health care due to demographic changes.

The Board was asked to adopt a Resolution which sets the health care rates consistent with the MOU with the Employees Association and the calculations above.

**Retirement Costs**  
Rates for FY 23/24 are as follows:
- Classic Employee Rate: 7% (paid by Employee)
- PEPRA Employee Rate: 7.75% (paid by Employee)
- Classic Employer Rate: 12.68% (paid by District)
- PEPRA Employer Rate: 7.68% (paid by District)

**Workers Compensation**  
There was a $7,745 decrease in the Workers Compensation insurance from what was budgeted for Preliminary Budget based on the actual invoice received from CAPRI.

**Service and Supply Cost Changes for Final Budget**  
The following substantial changes were made for final budget:
- $5,308 decrease in Business Conferences due to fewer staff attending the CRPS conference in Southern California;
- $10,872 increase in insurance liability costs based on the actual invoice from CAPRI.

**Capital Program Expenditures**  
No changes to the Capital Plan were made for final budget.

**FY 23/24 Intrafund Reimbursements Changes for Final Budget**
<!-- Page 88 -->
No changes were made for the Final Budget.

**FY 23/24 Property Tax Revenues - Property Taxes**  
Property Tax Revenue increased $19K from Preliminary to Final Budget based on actual collections and information from the Sacramento County Tax Assessor’s office.

**FY 23/24 Cell Tower Lease Revenues**  
No changes were made for Final Budget.

**FY 23/24 Facility Rental Revenues**  
The revenue projection for facility rentals was increased $10K after reviewing year-end totals for FY 23/24.

**Use of Contingency**  
The Final Budget contains contingency funding of $50,000 for FY 23/24.

---

**IV. Financial Analysis**  
The Final Budget contains full-year funding for permanent positions and provides an expenditure plan for base level operations and a variety of additions that are detailed above.

**Meeting Date:** August 16, 2023  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Adoption of Fiscal Year 2023-2024 Final Budget for the Bond Fund 341C  
**Prepared By:** Jennifer Larkin, Administrative Services Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Accept the recommendation of the Finance and Budget committee and adopt Resolution No. 081623-08: A Resolution of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Adopting FY 2023-2024 Final Budget for the Bond Fund 341C.

**II. Background**  
In November of 2018, the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District community passed Measure J, a general obligation bond, to fund capital projects in the District. The first series of bonds was issued in April of 2019, with the Director of Finance of Sacramento County acting as the District’s paying agent. The second series was issued in April of 2020. A third issuance is anticipated for late 2022 or early 2023.

Proceeds from both bond sales are held in a County fund, the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Building Fund, Election of 2018, Series 2019 and Series 2020, which is an investment fund that is not co-mingled with any other County funds but upon which the District may draw against for Bond projects.

This is the final budget which follows the adoption of the preliminary budget in June. No new items or projects have been added, and no changes were made.

**III. Financial Analysis**  
This budget includes the full funding for all Board approved bond projects. It also includes fund, legal services and audit services. This budget represents amounts approved by the
<!-- Page 116 -->
Board for projects. Funding cannot exceed approved amounts without further action from the Board.

Respectfully Submitted,  
Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

# STAFF REPORT

**Meeting Date:** August 16, 2023  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Reappointment of Bond Oversight Committee Members  

---

## I. Recommendation  
Reappoint the following Bond Oversight Committee members: Keith Walters for the period of March 1, 2023 to February 29, 2024; and Amy Larsen, Barbara Sesito, Dana Woodworker-Negri, Gary Juels, Justin Drake and Kim Sarkovich for the period of April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024.  

## II. Background  
The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District voters passed Measure J, a $26.9 Million Dollar General Obligation Bond Measure, in November 2018. The measure requires the creation of an independent Citizen Oversight Committee to monitor how the bond funds are used and to ensure they are spent only on the projects specified in the Bond Project List. The Bond Oversight Committee (BOC) is appointed by the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park Board (Board) and serves as a source of public input and accountability for the bond projects. The BOC works with the Board and the Staff to review, advise and comment on the issues and subjects related to Measure J Projects. The BOC does not have any legal authority separate from the District.  

On February 27, 2019, the Board approved the By-Laws for the Bond Oversight Committee (BOC). The BOC oversees the projects funded by Measure J, which have faced delays due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The original By-Laws limited the BOC members to five consecutive one-year terms, but some of them were nearing this limit. Therefore, in February 2023, the Board amended Term 2.3 of the By-Laws to allow the BOC members to serve as many one-year terms as the Board decides.
<!-- Page 128 -->
### III. Problem /Situation/ Request
The current Bond Committee Members that are up for reappointment have their appointment date after the February 2023 modification of Term 2.3 and staff is now requesting that the Board of Directors reappoint these members for the one-year term as required under Term 2.3 that was approved by the Board in February 2023.

### IV. Financial Analysis
There is no financial impact to the District.

Respectfully Submitted,  
Michael J. Aho

**Meeting Date:** August 16, 2023  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Submission of a Vote for Special District Commissioner for the Sacramento Local Agency Formation Commission (Sac LAFCo)  
**Prepared By:** Jennifer Larkin, Administrative Services Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Vote for one candidate for the position of Special District Commissioner for Office No. 7 of the Sacramento Local Agency Formation Commission (Sac LAFCo).

**II. Background**  
LAFCo's are state-mandated quasi-judicial countywide Commissions whose purview is to oversee boundary changes of cities and special districts, the formation of new agencies, including the incorporation of new cities and districts, and the consolidation or reorganization of special districts and/or cities. LAFCo has the power to approve, modify or deny proposals for Spheres of Influence (SOI), Annexations/Detachments, Incorporation, Formation of Special Districts, and Consolidations.

The broad goals of the Commission's directive are to ensure the orderly formation of local governmental agencies, to preserve agricultural and open space lands, and to discourage urban sprawl. Commissions must, by law, create Municipal Service Reviews and Update Spheres of Influence for each independent local governmental jurisdiction within their countywide jurisdiction.

Sac LAFCo is composed of seven Commission Members and five Alternate Commissioner Members. The composition of the “Regular” (e.g. voting)
<!-- Page 131 -->
Commissioners consists of the following classes: two members are members of the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors; two members are selected by the independent Special Districts located within the County of Sacramento; one member, appointed by the Mayor, serves on the City Council of the City of Sacramento; one member, appointed by the City Selection Committee, is a member of a City Council other than the City of Sacramento, located within the County of Sacramento. There is an alternate for each of these classes who can vote when the Regular Commission is absent or recused. These six Regular members of the Commission appoint both the Public Member Commissioner and the Alternate Public Member Commissioner.

### III. Problem /Situation / Request
The Special District Selection Committee is electing a regular representative to serve a new 4-year term beginning on January 1, 2024. The nominees for candidates are:

1. Lindsey Carter, Herald Fire Protection District.
2. Brian Danzl, Cordova Recreation and Park District.
3. Paul Lindsey, Florin Resource Conservation District.
4. Joanna McVay, North Highlands Recreation and Park District.
5. Edwin Perez, Reclamation District 1000.
6. Michael Seaman, Fulton-El Camino Recreation and Park District.
7. Robert “Bob” Wichert, Sacramento Suburban Water District.

SacLAFCo is requesting a vote by the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District’s Board of Directors for one candidate.

### IV. Financial Analysis
There is no financial impact associated with the staff recommendation.

Respectfully Submitted,

**MEMO**

**DATE:** July 18, 2023  
**TO:** Special District Presiding Officer  
**FROM:** José C. Henríquez, Executive Officer  
Sacramento Local Agency Formation Commission  
**SUBJECT:** Election of Special District Representative to Sacramento LAFCo  

The Special District Selection Committee is electing a regular representative to serve a new 4-year term beginning in January 1, 2024.

Due to the size of the Special District Selection Committee, it has been difficult to establish a quorum when meeting in person. Therefore, pursuant to the provisions of Government Code §56332(f), the Executive Officer has determined that the business of the Special District Selection Committee will be conducted in writing to elect a regular Special District Representative to Sacramento LAFCo.

**Election of Special District Representative to LAFCo**

Thank you for submitting nominations for the Special District Representative election.

At the time the election ends, in order to be selected as a LAFCo Representative, a nominee must receive more than fifty-percent (50%) of the submitted votes. Enclosed with this memo you will find a ballot and a copy of each candidate’s Statement of Qualifications received as of the date of this memo. Please note that there is one regular (voting) seat up for election.

**Special District Representative Elections**  
July 18, 2023  
Page 2 of 2  

The nominees, in alphabetical order, are:  
1) Lindsey Carter, Herald Fire Protection District  
2) Brian Danzl, Cordova Recreation & Park District  
3) Paul Lindsey, Florin Resource Conservation District  
4) Joanna McVay, North Highlands Recreation & Park District  
5) Edwin Perez, Reclamation District 1000  
6) Michael Seaman, Fulton El Camino Recreation & Park District  
7) Robert "Bob" Wichert, Sacramento Suburban Water District  

**Option of Electronic Elections**  
Government Code §56332(c)(4) gives LAFCo and Special Districts the option of completing the election of special district representatives via e-mail. This would be more convenient for some districts and a time/cost saver to LAFCo. In order to implement this, however, LAFCo needs to have the consent of the districts and an indication of those districts that wish to participate in this manner. There are two questions for your district to consider.  

1. On the first question, a "Yes" vote means you authorize LAFCo to send out ballots via e-mail to those special districts who choose to vote electronically in future elections. A "No" vote means LAFCo should continue to distribute paper ballots to all districts and distribute them via certified mail.  

2. On the second question, if a plurality of districts approves electronic voting in the first question, a "Yes" vote means you wish to receive electronic ballots in future elections and have the option to return your ballot in an electronic format (e-mail, fax or scanned ballot). A "No" vote means your district prefers to continue to receive and submit paper ballots.  

You can choose to vote "Yes" to the first question to authorize electronic distribution of ballots but vote "No" to the second if your District wants to continue to receive paper ballots.  

**Election Deadline**  
The voting period will be 75 days from July 18, 2023; all votes are due in writing on or before 5:00 pm on September 30, 2023. Voting will cease on this date or whenever a quorum of special districts is reached, whichever occurs later. Please do not forget to have the Board President, or Chair, or the presiding officer of the board meeting in which you made your selection sign the returned ballot.  

District managers or other staff members may not substitute their signature for Board President, or Chair, or the presiding officer’s signature.  

Thank you for your time and please feel free to contact me or any member of my staff at 916-874-2937 if you have any questions.

I currently serve as Vice Chair for the Florin Resource Conservation District (FRCD) which encompasses a good portion of southern Sacramento County. The District's work in recent years has been the provision of municipal water usage to roughly 40% of the city of Elk Grove.

Previously an Associate Director for the Florin Resource Conservation District, I was appointed to the Board to fill a vacancy and currently serve in my first full term. Retired after a 35-year career with the Social Security Administration, I worked in many different locations within California, from San Juan Capistrano to Yreka. During that time, I served in various positions, including Claims Specialist, Operations Supervisor, Area Systems Coordinator, and ultimately, District Manager. These positions required a thorough understanding of various laws and their application, IT systems, budgeting, and human resources.

My wife and I settled in Elk Grove in 1985 and I've been very involved in Civic Advisory Commission for Elk Grove prior to its incorporation (and was heavily involved in several incorporation efforts) and was a charter member of the original Planning Commission for the City of Elk Grove, serving on it for more than seven years. I also chaired the East Elk Grove Specific Area Planning Advisory Group. Recently, I also served on the Sacramento County Grand Jury for two years (much of which was spent reviewing Special Districts, their operations, and practices). I served two years on the Cosumnes Community Service District's Landscape and Lighting Committee. During these different activities, I was able to interact with LAFCO on a variety of issues and gained an understanding of its responsibilities and duties.

I ask for your support for this position on LAFCO's Commission because I believe that I can bring a fresh perspective to the Commission and a willingness to listen, learn, and represent Special District interests on the Commission.

**STATEMENT OF QUALIFICATIONS**

I am seeking a seat on the Sacramento LAFCO to leverage my years of professional experience in the areas of community engagement, organizational governance, and collaboration with various levels of government to effectively represent special districts on the commission.

I was elected in 2022 as Trustee with Reclamation District 1000, the flood control agency for the Natomas Basin. In this brief period of time, I was able to leverage my extensive relationships with community members and organizations to help win voter approval of a stormwater service fee to fund much needed infrastructure maintenance and help ensure a flood-safe future for the Natomas Basin.

I have served as a City of Sacramento Commissioner, President of a 1,300 household homeowners association, board member of California's largest state employee organization, and served on the board of numerous community and non-profit organizations.

In these roles, I learned to value the input from concerned residents, the importance of collaborating with community partners, and the need to pay attention to details and also see the "big picture". These experiences have prepared me to serve on the LAFCO.

I would be honored to receive your vote and look forward to working with you.

Respectfully,  
ED PEREZ
