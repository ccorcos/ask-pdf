**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
San Juan Unified School District schools annually review and revise their school plans based on current data analysis and the latest research using a collaborative process involving members of the school community. The Division of Teaching and Learning staff have worked with site leaders to ensure that their plans include a comprehensive needs assessment, input from educational partners, and the identification of resource inequities. The SPSA outlines specific strategies for improving student outcomes through goals and actions that are aligned to the district’s Strategic Plan and the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and comply with federal program regulations. The SPSA provides site leaders and educational partners with the opportunity to collaborate around goals and actions to mitigate resource inequities and promote equitable student outcomes. The SPSA is an additional tool to advance our focus on strategic results.

Following anticipated approval by the board, plans will be posted online to enhance communication and transparency for parents and community members.

**GRANT HIGHLIGHT**  
"This project has met and exceeded my expectations! Students are incredibly engaged in our work through the puppets and love getting to have them visit us! I am continually asked if the students can meet more or see specific puppets. Another way that this project has exceeded my expectations is in the area of assessment. Now with the use of a puppet I have encountered new ways to ask students to be assessed in front of a large group in a way that feels safe and encouraging. We are having a lot of fun with our new friends in the classroom! Thank you SJEF!"

### AGENDA ITEM: I-3  
### MEETING DATE: 08/08/2023  

**SUBJECT:** Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators  
**DEPARTMENT:** Human Resources  

---

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt the Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators for the 2023-2024 school year.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Human Resources staff has followed the policies and procedures for hiring fully-credentialed teachers to staff schools for the 2023-2024 school year. While a thorough search continues to be conducted for fully-credentialed teachers, in order to staff all classrooms, Human Resources still anticipates a need to assign certain teachers on the basis of an emergency authorization (Internship, English Learner Authorization, Limited Assignment Permit, Short-Term Staff Permit, Provisional Internship Permit, etc.). Before this can occur, this Declaration of Need must be adopted by the Board of Education and filed with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing.  

In addition, the California Department of Education in collaboration with the Commission on Teacher Credentialing will audit the entire district for credential mis-assignments. Although every effort is made to properly staff our schools, occasionally mis-assignments are identified and it becomes necessary to request a limited assignment permit to correct mis-assignments.

May 31, 2023  

To Whom It May Concern,  

Upon reading the posting for the election of School and Community College District Representative for the County of Sacramento Treasury Oversight Committee I felt that my experience and interest in a better understanding of the county investment policy and portfolio, make me an ideal candidate.  

I have 30 years of financial leadership experience including over a decade working in financial institutions and 18 years as the Chief Fiscal Officer (CFO) for public school districts.  

Currently, I am the Assistant Superintendent of Business Services for the Folsom Cordova Unified School District in Sacramento County. In this role, I manage a $300 million general fund budget, a $1 billion district bond program, fiscal services, payroll, risk management, transportation, and food service, that supports over 2,500 employees and 21,000 students.  

Additionally, I am an executive board member with Schools Insurance Authority, a leader in the education community for school property, liability, and workers’ compensation insurance and risk management. I am also a former board member with the Placerville Union School District, serving for five years, with the last three years in the role as Board President.  

I believe my experience on several boards, and as a CFO would make me a resource to this committee, and it would be an honor to serve as a representative of the students, schools, and community college districts in Sacramento County on the Treasury Oversight Committee.  

I sincerely thank you for your vote.
